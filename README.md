## 📖 Introducing our dataset

In this notebook, we will explore the MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9). We will implement various classification algorithms to recognize these digits and evaluate their performance.

## 🗂️ Understanding Your Dataset

This section provides an overview of the MNIST dataset, including its structure, features, and target labels. We will load the dataset and visualize some sample images to understand the data better.Before training our models, we will preprocess the data. This includes:
- Reshaping the images if necessary
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

## ⚙️ Training a Binary Classifier

In this section, we will train a binary classifier to distinguish between two classes (e.g., digits '0' and '1'). We will use techniques such as:
- Logistic Regression
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier

## 📏 Performance Measures

We will evaluate the performance of our models using various metrics, including:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

## 🔍 Multiclass Classification

Here, we will extend our approach to handle multiclass classification, where the model predicts one out of multiple classes (digits 0-9). We will explore models like:
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Random Forest Classifier

## 📊 Multilabel Classification

In this section, we will address multilabel classification problems where a single instance can belong to multiple classes. We will implement models that can handle such cases effectively.

## 🔄 Multioutput Classification

We will explore multioutput classification, where the model predicts multiple outputs for each input. This section will include examples and model implementations.
